go is statically typed and compiled

why go ??

1. fast and light weight 
2. easily concurrent
3. easy and simple
4. compiled
5.statically typed 
6.garbage collected

Go program structure
We'll go over this all later in more detail, but to sate your curiosity:

package main lets the Go compiler know that we want this code to compile and run as a standalone program, as opposed to being a library that's imported by other programs.
import "fmt" imports the fmt (formatting) package from the standard library. It allows us to use fmt.Println to print to the console.
func main() defines the main function, the entry point for a Go program.
Two kinds of bugs
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of errors in programming:

Compilation errors. Occur when code is compiled. It's generally better to have compilation errors because they'll never accidentally make it into production. You can't ship a program with a compiler error because the resulting executable won't even be created.
Runtime errors. Occur when a program is running. These are generally worse because they can cause your program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Type Sizes
Integers, uints, floats, and complex numbers all have type sizes.

Whole Numbers (no decimal)
int  int8  int16  int32  int64


Positive Whole Numbers (no decimal)
"uint" stands for "unsigned integer".

uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

Signed Decimal Numbers
float32 float64

Imaginary Numbers (rarely used)
complex64 complex128

Key Strengths of Go:
Simplicity:

Go’s syntax is clean, minimalistic, and easy to understand. It avoids many of the complexities found in other languages such as inheritance, method overloading, or annotations.
This simplicity leads to faster learning and development, which is particularly beneficial for teams and projects where rapid iteration and scaling are essential.
Concurrency:

Go has built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels. It uses the CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) model to allow concurrent execution of tasks in a highly efficient way.
Goroutines are lightweight and consume much fewer resources than threads in languages like Java, making Go ideal for building scalable systems like web servers, microservices, and real-time applications.
Performance:

Go compiles down to machine code, leading to highly optimized and fast execution times, comparable to C/C++.
It provides automatic memory management (garbage collection) but does so efficiently, making it a good balance between ease of use and performance.
Compilation Speed:

Go has a very fast compiler, allowing for quick iterations during the development cycle. The entire codebase compiles to a single executable, reducing dependency complexity and deployment time.
Cross-Platform:

Go is designed to be platform-independent, allowing you to build cross-platform applications without much hassle. The same code can be compiled for different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux easily.
Built-in Tools:

Go comes with a rich set of tools for formatting, testing, building, and profiling code (gofmt, go test, etc.). This fosters consistency and helps developers maintain a high-quality codebase.
Strong Ecosystem:

Go has strong libraries for networking, web development, and cloud-native applications (e.g., Docker and Kubernetes are written in Go). It’s commonly used in microservice architectures and cloud infrastructure.
Static Typing with Ease:

Go offers static typing (compile-time checks) with the ease of a dynamically typed language. This helps catch errors early in the development process, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.
Memory Management:

While Go uses garbage collection, it allows for more fine-grained control over memory management (e.g., through pointers), which can result in better performance compared to high-level languages like Python or Java.

Why Use Go Over Other Languages:
Concurrency Support:

In languages like Java or C++, managing concurrency is often more complex and error-prone (e.g., dealing with threads and locks). Go’s goroutines are simpler, more efficient, and scalable, making Go a natural choice for concurrent applications.
Ease of Development:

Compared to OOP languages where design patterns and hierarchies can become over-complicated, Go’s simplicity promotes writing clear and straightforward code. This reduces complexity, which is critical for maintainability, especially in large-scale systems.
Fast and Scalable Microservices:

Go’s speed, concurrency model, and small memory footprint make it a great choice for building microservices or cloud-native applications. Languages like Java require more resources to achieve the same level of scalability.
DevOps and Cloud-Native:

Go is heavily used in modern cloud environments and DevOps tools. Technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform are written in Go, making it the go-to language for cloud infrastructure and automation.
No Legacy Baggage:

Go is a modern language built from the ground up, meaning it doesn’t carry the legacy features and baggage that languages like Java or C++ do. This helps avoid overengineering solutions.

When to Choose Go:
If you're building highly scalable web services or microservices.
When you need high-performance applications but want to avoid the complexity of languages like C++.
For applications with high concurrency needs, such as real-time systems, servers, or cloud-native apps.
In situations where developer productivity and a fast learning curve are crucial.
For building command-line tools or DevOps-related applications.
When Not to Use Go:
If you need deep OOP features like inheritance, or are building applications that rely heavily on traditional OOP paradigms.
For front-end development (Go is not designed for front-end frameworks or UI applications).
If your application requires extensive third-party libraries that aren’t yet available in Go (though its ecosystem is rapidly growing).
